# DipoleLattice.jl

This package provides set of routines to calculate scattering properties of free standing and supported 2D periodic arrays of magnetoelectric dipolar particles. It is assumed that the scattering properties of these particles can be given by 6x6 dipole polarizability tensor ``\alpha``
```math
\alpha = \begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_{ee} & \alpha_{em}\\
\alpha_{me} & \alpha_{mm}
\end{bmatrix}
```
where, each of ``\alpha_{i, j}``, ``i, j = {e, m}`` are three by three matrices that describe the particleelectric and magnetic polarizabilities as well as their cross-coupling.
