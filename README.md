# DipoleLattice.jl
This package implements various routines to calculate various scattering and guiding properties of 2D periodic arrays of dipole scatterers. The calculations are based on the assumption that the scttering of these particles can be described using their electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities that are assumed to be given as an input. The package can calculate far-field reflectrion and transmision spectra of the array. Dispersion spectrum and the waveguide modes. The calculations can be done for suspended and supported array as well as for layers of dipole arrays and homogenous film. The codes can also calculate the decay lifetime of a single emitter located near such 2D periodic arrays of scatterers.
