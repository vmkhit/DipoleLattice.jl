# DipoleLattice.jl
This package implements various routines to calculate various scattering and guiding properties of 2D periodic arrays of dipole scatterers. The calculations are based on the assumption that the scttering of these particles can be described using their electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities that are assumed to be given as an input.
